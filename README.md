# Database

Database is generated by model-fisrt using .Net migrations. This is the ER diagram:

So the model will be:

- A User has one House, and one House can have many users.
- One House has many Rooms, and one Room can have many Houseworks.
- One User can have many Houseworks too (Houseworks assigned to users to complete).
- One Housework can have many HouseworksWeekly.
